# gitlogformat
A tool to generate git log commands.

This tool can be used to create git log commands with specific filters and output formats easily without digging through documentation. It supports the addition of custom arguments on top of the easily selectable choices. It also has a function to hyperlink each log entry to it's corresponding commit on a remote repository in a format that can be copied and pasted into an email client (or anything that supports html formatting).
